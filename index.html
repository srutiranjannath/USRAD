<h2>USRAD Farming</h2>
<h3> Do Eat Feed </h3>
<hr style="width:40%;text-align:left;margin-left:0">
<h4>Mainly focous on How to stable our food marcket ? 
    <br><br>
    Befor our organisation started in year 2018-19 our voulentiours face Essincial Product price automatically incress and discreese.
    Then our leader Jayprakash Patra make a research and find our Essincial Product price automatically incress because of we import our product 
    outer state . Product making cost is very low but when we import its added labour charges, transpotation charges, brockerge charges,
    suplyer perfit, retailer perfit and many other direct expencess cost. so that a product making cost Rs 5 but a castomer purche it on Rs 150.
    <br><br>
    But Our state is capable to makeing product in Rs 5 so why we perchese it on Rs 150 ?
    <br><br>
    In this year 2020 we faced Covid-19 Pendamic but ont only Covid-19 we faced this issue is a big probleam standing infront of us.<br>
    So that we need a permanet salutation of this probleam.then we face any pendamic without any food probleam otherwise we can't face a small 
    pendmic like flood and cyclone. Because when a cyclone comes in our food price automatically incresed so many poor familyes stay in 
    hungry . its not fair 
    <br><br>
    Our Organisation Started work and make many research of this topic but its not a small probleam its takes many times to solve. 
    <br> <br>
    Still now one reserch programe "USRAD Farming" comes out in a conclusion. Its Moto "DO EAT FEED"<br>
    We saw in our state many Goverment and Private land stay in blank. Nothing happend in this land but still those land suitable for farming then
    then if a goverment land stay in blank we applay for NOC if NOC approved then we started farming in this land through local farmers.<br>
    If a private land stay in blank we contact the Owner and discous about our project. if they agree and intrested we started farming on their land.<br>
    then we open a store naming @20 for sailing our vegitables also we provide indivisual farmers sell their farming product through our store 
    in conditions.<br>
    if they comes store we purchese their product Rs 15 and Sell Rs 20, If we comes farmers land we purchese their product Rs 10 and sell Rs 20
    in our @20 store beacuse of transpotation charges.
    <br><br>
    we Make @20 store in this tearms and conditations because we mainly focous on How to stable our food marcket so we think vegitable cost doesn't
    cross rs20 and our local farmers also indivisual farmers are benifited through this store beacuse they know How to sell ? Where to sell ? and 
    How much they get ? also they know they give their product in brocker free hand. so they trust on the store.<br>

    <h4> Today our Veichles are fully depend on fule. when ue use fule engine our Envourment gone polluted and fule also very Expencive so that 
        Everyone intrested in use electric veichle. But Most of electric Veichle are depends on battery and charging Concept. this Concept Very old 
        and its not user frendely so that Electric Veichle are not captur marcket.<br>
